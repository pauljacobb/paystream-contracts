Soroban smart contracts for **PayStream** — decentralized payroll and salary streaming on the Stellar blockchain.

## REST API

The `api/` directory contains a Node.js/Express wrapper around the Soroban stream contracts.

### Endpoints

All responses follow the shape `{ success: boolean, data: object|null, error: string|null }`.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/streams` | Create a new payment stream. Body: `{ sender, recipient, amount, duration }`. Stubs a `create_stream` contract call. |
| `GET` | `/streams/:id` | Fetch current state of a stream by ID. Stubs a `get_stream` contract call. |
| `POST` | `/streams/:id/withdraw` | Trigger a withdrawal from a stream. Body: `{ amount }`. Stubs a `withdraw` contract call. |

### Running locally

```bash
cd api
npm install
npm start   # http://localhost:3001
```

PayStream lets employers stream salaries to employees in real-time, per-second. Instead of waiting for a monthly paycheck, employees earn and can withdraw their salary continuously as they work — fully on-chain, trustless, and transparent.

> 🎬 **[Watch the PayStream stream creation tutorial](docs/video-tutorial.md)** — under 10 minutes, includes wallet setup, create stream, withdraw, and captions.

## Why PayStream?

- **Real-time pay** — employees access earned wages any time, not just payday
- **Trustless escrow** — funds locked on-chain; employer cannot claw back earned salary
- **Transparent** — every stream, withdrawal, and cancellation is an immutable on-chain event
- **Stellar-native** — built on Stellar's fast, low-fee infrastructure with Soroban smart contracts
- **Flexible** — pause, resume, top-up, or cancel streams; optional hard stop time
- **Multi-token** — each stream can use any [SEP-41](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0041.md) compliant token; employer and employee can run concurrent streams in different assets

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable)
- [Stellar CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/tools/developer-tools/cli/stellar-cli)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vera3289/paystream-contracts.git
cd paystream-contracts
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Build

```bash
make build
# or: stellar contract build
```

### Test

```bash
make test
# or: cargo test
```

### Format & Lint

```bash
make fmt-check
make lint
```

---

### Docker (no local Rust/Stellar CLI required)

Build and test entirely inside Docker — no local Rust or Stellar CLI installation needed.

**Run tests:**
```bash
docker compose run --rm test
```

**Build contracts only:**
```bash
docker compose run --rm build stellar contract build
```

The `cargo-cache` volume persists the Cargo registry between runs so subsequent builds are fast.

### Functions

| Function | Caller | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `initialize(admin)` | Admin | Set contract admin |
| `create_stream(employer, employee, token, deposit, rate_per_second, stop_time)` | Employer | Create stream, lock deposit |
| `create_streams_batch(employer, params)` | Employer | Create multiple streams atomically; all succeed or all revert |
| `withdraw(employee, stream_id)` | Employee | Withdraw all claimable earnings |
| `top_up(employer, stream_id, amount)` | Employer | Add more funds to active stream |
| `pause_stream(employer, stream_id)` | Employer | Pause accrual |
| `resume_stream(employer, stream_id)` | Employer | Resume accrual |
| `cancel_stream(employer, stream_id)` | Employer | Pay employee earned share, refund remainder |
| `get_stream(stream_id)` | Anyone | Read stream state |
| `claimable(stream_id)` | Anyone | Query withdrawable amount right now |
| `stream_count()` | Anyone | Total streams created |

### Batch vs Individual Stream Creation — Fee Comparison

| Approach | Transactions | Approx. fee |
|---|---|---|
| N individual `create_stream` calls | N | N × base fee |
| One `create_streams_batch` call | 1 | 1 × base fee + per-stream resource overhead |

`create_streams_batch` is cheaper for N ≥ 2 because Stellar charges one base fee per transaction. Per-stream resource overhead grows linearly but is far smaller than the per-transaction base fee saved.

### Stream Status Lifecycle

```
Active → Paused → Active
Active → Cancelled
Active → Exhausted  (deposit fully streamed)
```

### Claimable Calculation

```
claimable = min(
    (now - last_withdraw_time) * rate_per_second,
    deposit - withdrawn
)
```

Time is capped at `stop_time` if set. Paused time is excluded.

## Using USDC as the Payment Token

PayStream is token-agnostic — any [SEP-41](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0041.md) compliant token works. The recommended default is **Stellar USDC** issued by Circle.

### USDC Contract Addresses

| Network | Contract Address |
|---|---|
| Testnet | `GBBD47IF6LWK7P7MDEVSCWR7DPUWV3NY3DTQEVFL4NAT4AQH3ZLLFLA5` |
| Mainnet | `GA5ZSEJYB37JRC5AVCIA5MOP4RHTM335X2KGX3IHOJAPP5RE34K4KZVN` |

Source: [Circle — Stellar USDC](https://developers.circle.com/stablecoins/stellar-usdc)

### Creating a USDC Stream (JavaScript)

```js
import { CONFIG, USDC } from "./config";

// 1 USDC = 10_000_000 stroops (7 decimal places on Stellar)
const ONE_USDC = 10_000_000n;

await contract.create_stream({
  employer:        myPublicKey,
  employee:        employeePublicKey,
  token_address:   USDC.testnet,          // swap for USDC.mainnet in prod
  deposit:         ONE_USDC * 3600n,      // 3600 USDC
  rate_per_second: ONE_USDC,              // 1 USDC / second
  stop_time:       0n,                    // no hard stop
  cooldown_period: 0n,
  cliff_time:      0n,
});
```

The demo UI pre-fills the token field with the testnet USDC address automatically via `CONFIG.defaultToken`.
