## [Unreleased]

### Release notes process (how this changelog is updated)

- The project uses **git-cliff** (`cliff.toml`) with **Conventional Commits**.
- During development, merged PRs update the `**[Unreleased]**` section.
- When cutting a version/tag, git-cliff generates a new version section from commits since the previous tag.
- For additional narrative (migrations/operational notes), add it under the version heading in this file.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-24


### Added

- Initial `StreamContract` with `create_stream`, `withdraw`, `top_up`, `pause_stream`, `resume_stream`, and `cancel_stream` entrypoints
- Initial `TokenContract` (SEP-41 compliant) with `initialize`, `transfer`, `transfer_from`, `approve`, `mint`, and `burn`
- Per-second salary streaming with configurable `rate_per_second` and optional `stop_time`
- `claimable` and `claimable_at` query functions for real-time and projected earnings
- `create_streams_batch` for atomic multi-stream creation in a single transaction
- Multi-token support — each stream accepts any SEP-41 compliant token address
- Per-employer and per-employee stream index (`streams_by_employer`, `streams_by_employee`)
- Emergency contract-level `pause_contract` / `unpause_contract` for admin
- Admin-governed minimum deposit enforcement (`set_min_deposit`)
- Contract upgrade path via `upgrade` (WASM hash swap) and `migrate` (no-op base hook)
- Reentrancy guard (`locked` flag) on `withdraw` as defence-in-depth (issue #1)
- Checked arithmetic throughout `claimable_amount` to prevent silent overflow (issue #2)
- Zero-rate validation — `create_stream` rejects `rate_per_second = 0` with `E001` (issue #3)
- Graceful `withdraw` on exhausted streams returns `0` instead of panicking (issue #10)
- `top_up` rejects cancelled (`E005`) and exhausted (`E006`) streams (issue #11)
- Pause/resume time-accounting — paused intervals excluded from claimable calculation (issue #15)
- `StreamStatus` lifecycle: `Active → Paused → Active`, `Active → Cancelled`, `Active → Exhausted`
- On-chain events: `created`, `withdraw`, `status`, `topup`, `paused`
- Rust toolchain pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml`
- Docker-based local development environment (`docker-compose.yml`)
- GitHub Actions CI with build, test, lint, and `cargo audit` vulnerability scanning
- Branch protection script (`scripts/protect-main.sh`)
- Security audit report (Trail of Bits, 2026-04-23) — all high/medium findings resolved
- Gas optimisation pass: `withdraw` CPU instructions reduced ~19%, `claimable` ~21%
- Upgrade guide (`docs/upgrade-guide.md`)

### Security

- `top_up` now verifies `employer == stream.employer` before token transfer (audit HIGH-01)
- `claimable_amount` uses `checked_mul` to prevent overflow; panics with `E004` on overflow (audit MED-01)
- Reentrancy analysis documented; `locked` guard added as defence-in-depth (audit MED-02)
